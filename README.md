## Codecrafters

The general idea of this project and some parts of bencode decoding were made with the [codecrafters challenges](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/bittorrent/stages/ah1).
Due to the codecrafters tests being paid access only after integer decoding, I've chosen to take my own path for this project and vaguely follow the ideas of the challenges.
